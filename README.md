#### DBZ Online
This project was made to test a Unity package called NetCode for GameObjects.
It's a really simple game made just for learning. The code is not so good either, but it works!

#### Features
Jump with the spacebar
LMB to punch, kick
RBM to charge your Ki for ranged attacks
E for launching the energy ball

#### WARNING!!!
For testing this game on your machine, go to the Inspector and put the IP in the network object as 127.0.0.1 (localhost), then build your game (or use parrel sync)
For testing in LAN, put your IP address on your network, build it, and send the game to the person you want to play with.
(Sorry for not adding the option to connect to a specific IP feature, it will probably be added in a future commit)
